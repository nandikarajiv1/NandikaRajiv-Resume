        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I am Nandika Rajiv, and I am a Pre-Business major at the University of California, Riverside. As a Pre-Business major, I hope to specialize in Marketing in the future, and have taken many steps to gain experience for this. 
In high school, I held the position of Head Marketing Director for an organization called Vitiligo Pride, where I organized many events and fundraisers in order to spread awareness about the skin disease called Vitiligo. In addition, I also handled the social media of the organization, and created posts that fit with the organization’s brand in order to gain publicity and a following. I also reached out to other organizations and companies to work out sponsorships and fundraisers.
I currently hold the position of Social Media Chair for UCR Abhinaya, UC Riverside’s classical dance team. I create and design original posts in order to promote our dancers and their performances. This brings the team more publicity and reaches out to other dancers that might be interested in joining. I also reach out to other dance teams through email in order to organize collaborations. 
<br><br>

        I have also taken important coursework in order to gain more knowledge. While taking Introduction to Business, I created a detailed business plan featuring a new product and marketing it towards a company. For this project, I used financial statements from similar companies to formulate balance sheets and income statements, and also created several marketing strategies to show how the product can become successful. 
I also have taken the class Financial Accounting and Reporting, where I learned how to make financial statements using information given to me about the company. This included learning how to make an income statement, a cash flow statement, and a balance sheet. 
<br><br>

        Furthermore, I have taken on other positions that have helped me develop my public speaking abilities, which are extremely important when it comes to giving presentations. I attended a Toastmasters Public Speaking program, where I learned helpful tips about how to write effective and well structured speeches, and also learned about keeping eye contact, movement on stage, diction, and more. 
I later used these lessons in the position of Link Crew Leader in high school, where I led a group of freshmen through many team building activities to make them feel more welcome and comfortable at their new school. I also introduced them to many areas around campus and answered any questions they had. 
Furthermore, I still use these public speaking skills currently in my job as a tutor for EPATT. I work with two students every week, helping them with their math and reading skills by prompting them to solve problems by themselves with helpful questions and hints. I also create lesson plans and present them in an efficient and timely manner, highlighting the most important parts.
